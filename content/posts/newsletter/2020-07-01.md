## Subscribe to the newsletter

We suggest you [Subscribe](https://tinyletter.com/xmpp) to receive the next editions in your inbox as soon as it is published! Promote this newsletter to whoever may be interested.

## Help us to build the newsletter

We started drafting every new issue in the [XSF Github repository](https://github.com/xsf/xmpp.org/pulls). 
And we are always happy to welcome contributors. Just join the discussion in our [Comm-Team group chat (MUC)](xmpp:commteam@muc.xmpp.org?join) and thereby help us sustain this as a community effort. 

You have a project and (want to) write about it? Please consider sharing your news or events here, and promote it to a large audience! Even if you can only spend a few minutes, these would already be helpful.
Tasks which need to be done on a regular basis are for example:
- Aggregation of news in the XMPP universe
- Short formulation of news and events
- Summary of the monthly communication on extensions (XEP)
- Review of the draft
- Translations: especially French, German and Spanish

### Newsletter translations

Translations of the XMPP Newsletter will be released here:

## XSF Announcements

JC Brand created an [XMPP job board](https://xmpp.work/)! This enabled people to review job offers as well as advertise XMPP services. Please take a look, post your own offers and recommend it. XMPP works!

## Article

Ingo Jürgensmann wrote an article on the backround of the 'Jabber' and 'XMPP' terminology and their [differences and similarities](https://blog.windfluechter.net/content/blog/2020/06/09/1758-jabber-vs-xmpp).

The XMPP client Dino is one out of three projects which were awarded with the [10th Thomas Krenn Award](https://www.thomas-krenn.com/de/unternehmen/presse/pressemeldung.thomas-krenn-award-2020.html) (German).

## Video

:es: Conociendo XMPP - The 'Comunidad Latina de Tecnologías Libres' had an online introduction to XMPP for users back in April 2020. We would like to [point you to the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwnzJ9V732E), even if it is a bit late. They also offer a user chat reachable under this (short and handy) address
[comunidadlatinadetecnologiaslibres@chat.disroot.org](xmpp:comunidadlatinadetecnologiaslibres@chat.disroot.org?join).

Daniel Gultsch and Holger Weiss had a [virtual talk on their A/V implementation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_riuu4XU6Q) in Conversation and describe the technical details. eta finalized the session with a second talk by defining love by this formula: Asterisk + XMPP = <3

:de: Prof. Dr. P. Löbbecke spoke in a virtual talk about "[Freie Messenger - Sichere Kommunikation](https://libre.video/videos/watch/1b646209-24e0-489b-8060-793f4513da9d)" ('Free Messengers - Secure Communication') which also included XMPP (German).

[Gajim 1.2.0](https://gajim.org/post/2020-06-21-gajim-1.2.0-released/) has been released. More than a year after the release of Gajim 1.1.3 it is finally time for Gajim 1.2. A year of developing new features, cleaning up old code, and bug fixing. Highlights of this release are (amongst others): improved group chat system, completely rewritten network code, and a new account creation assistant. But there is much more to discover.

[Gajim Development News](https://gajim.org/post/2020-06-28-development-news-june/): June already brought Gajim 1.2, python-nbxmpp 1.0, and many plugin updates. But there is more: Blind Trust Before Verification for OMEMO, drag and drop improvements, and a new translation service for Gajim.

Profanity released its version 0.9.0 which supports Last Message Correction (XEP-0308) and fix various issues that can be found in their [blog post](https://profanity-im.github.io/blog/post/release-090/). After the new major release the bugfix releases [0.9.1](https://github.com/profanity-im/profanity/releases/tag/0.9.1), [0.9.2](https://github.com/profanity-im/profanity/releases/tag/0.9.2), [0.9.3](https://github.com/profanity-im/profanity/releases/tag/0.9.3) and [0.9.4](https://github.com/profanity-im/profanity/releases/tag/0.9.4) followed.

[JSXC](https://jsxc.org) released [version 4.1.1](https://github.com/jsxc/jsxc/releases/tag/v4.1.1) which fixes several video related issues and enhances the interoperability with Conversations. Additionally a [first experimental desktop build](https://www.jsxc.org/blog/2020/06/25/JSXC-Desktop.html) for all platforms was released. The project is looking for early testers and people with experience in Electron and the Travis build chain.

## Libraries

Gajim’s XMPP library '[python-nbxmpp](https://dev.gajim.org/gajim/python-nbxmpp/-/tree/master)' had its 1.0 release. Being a friendly fork of the xmppy library back in the days, many things changed since then. A lot of work went into it, especially during the past year. If you’re interested, there is a simple example client included.

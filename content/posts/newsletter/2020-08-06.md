Welcome to the XMPP newsletter covering the month of July 2020.

## Subscribe to the newsletter

We suggest you [Subscribe](https://tinyletter.com/xmpp) to receive the next editions in your inbox as soon as it is published! 
Promote this newsletter to whoever may be interested.

## Help us to build the newsletter

We started drafting every new issue in the [XSF Github repository](https://github.com/xsf/xmpp.org/pulls). 

We are always happy to welcome contributors. Do not hesitate to join the discussion in our 
[Comm-Team group chat (MUC)](xmpp:commteam@muc.xmpp.org?join) and thereby help us sustain this as a community effort. 

You have a project and write about it? Please consider sharing your news or events here, and promote it to a large audience! 
Even if you can only spend a few minutes, these would already be helpful!

Tasks which need to be done on a regular basis are for example:
- Aggregation of news in the XMPP universe
- Short formulation of news and events
- Summary of the monthly communication on extensions (XEP)
- Review of the newsletter draft
- Translations: especially German and Spanish

### Newsletter translations

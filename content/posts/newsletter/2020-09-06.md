### Clients and applications

[Gajim Development News (September)](https://gajim.org/post/2020-09-27-development-news-september/): ðŸ¥³ This monthâ€™s post marks one year of Gajim Development News! The rework of Gajimâ€™s Preferences window has been completed. We improved group chat invitations and made group chat settings easier to access. Also, joining a group chat is now much prettier.

MCabber, the venerable old text UI client, has been released in [version 1.1.1](https://github.com/McKael/mcabber/releases/tag/1.1.1). Apart from bugfixes, support for displaying the number of unread messages and refactorization of carbon message handling has been implemented.

The python SDK for GE WiFi-enabled kitchen appliances, [gekitchen](https://github.com/ajmarks/gekitchen), made its first github release. The primary goal is to use it to power integrations for [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/), though that will probably need to wait on some new entity types. It is using XMPP as a mean to authenticate since it is what the The GE SmartHQ app uses to communicate with devices.

formulated description of what is the main outcome of your source. This will help us a lot!

No chance for SPAM: Openfire presents their new ['Spam blacklist' plugin](https://discourse.igniterealtime.org/t/new-openfire-plugin-to-help-reduce-spam/88730) to enable reporting for users. Please report potential spammers!

The Prosody XMPP server team have been busy this month with several exciting things. Firstly, the [Prosody 0.11.6 release announcement](https://blog.prosody.im/prosody-0.11.6-released/). They also published a suite of new modules to allow [simple invite-based account registration](https://blog.prosody.im/great-invitations/) which can help guide new users through choosing a suitable client and registering their first XMPP account. Finally they published a round-up of advice for everyone on how to [help address spam on the XMPP network](https://blog.prosody.im/simple-anti-spam-tips/).

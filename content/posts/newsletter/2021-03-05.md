## Software news

### Clients and applications

[Conversations 2.9.7 has been released](https://github.com/iNPUTmice/Conversations/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md), adding the ability to select incoming call ringtone, fixing OpenPGP key id discovery for OpenKeychain 5.6+, improving stability of RTP session establishment (calling), and more.

Five months have passed since the release of Gajim 1.2.2. Many new features have been developed during this time, including a complete redesign of both Gajim’s Preferences window and configuration backend, an all new Profile window, support for Chat Markers, a new user interface for voice/video calls, and much more. As covered in [February's development news](https://gajim.org/post/2021-02-25-development-news-february/), February brought mostly bug fixes. The Profile window’s error handling has been improved, and selecting small images for an avatar should now work as expected. While fixing those bugs, Gajim’s team has been working on something big.

[Kaidan 0.7 has been released](https://www.kaidan.im/2021/02/02/kaidan-0.7.0/): This release enables users to send files via drag and drop. Furthermore, it is now possible to see which chat client and operating system a contact is using.

It also adds a simple portal for non-administrative users to log in and manage their account.

And there is more: Raspberry Pi and ARM support, and the introduction of user groups, known as "circles".

[python-nbxmpp 2.0.1 and 2.0.2 have been released](https://gajim.org/post/2021-02-25-development-news-february/), both addressing multiple bugs.

## Extensions and specifications

Developers and other standards experts from around the world collaborate on these extensions, developing new specifications for emerging practices, and refining existing ways of doing things. Proposed by anybody, the particularly successful ones end up as Final or Active - depending on their type - while others are carefully archived as Deferred. This life cycle is described in [XEP-0001](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0001.html), which contains the formal and canonical definitions for the types, states, and processes. [Read more about the standards process](https://xmpp.org/about/standards-process.html). Communication around Standards and Extensions happens in the [Standards Mailing List](https://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/standards) ([online archive](https://mail.jabber.org/pipermail/standards/)).

### Proposed

The XEP development process starts by writing up an idea and submitting it to the XMPP Editor. Within two weeks, the Council decides whether to accept this proposal as an Experimental XEP.

-   [Implicit XMPP WebSocket Endpoints](https://xmpp.org/extensions/inbox/xep-iwe.html)
    -   This document specifies implicit connection endpoints for XMPP over WebSocket (RFC 7395).

### New

-   Version 0.2.0 of [XEP-0455](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0455.html) (Service Outage Status)
    -   This document defines an XMPP protocol extension that enables server administrators to communicate issues with the server to all users in a semantic manner.

### Deferred

If an experimental XEP is not updated for more than six months, it will be moved off Experimental to Deferred. If there is another update, it will put the XEP back onto Experimental.

-   No XEPs deferred this month.

### Updated

-   Version 0.2.0 of [XEP-0452](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0452.html) (MUC Mention Notifications)
    -   Require nickname registration for notifications to work (jcb)

### Last Call

Last calls are issued once everyone seems satisfied with the current XEP status. After the Council decides whether the XEP seems ready, the XMPP Editor issues a Last Call for comments. The feedback gathered during the Last Call help improving the XEP before returning it to the Council for advancement to Draft.

-   No new Last Call this month.

### Draft

-   No Drafts this month.

### Call for Experience

A Call For Experience - like a Last Call, is an explicit call for comments, but in this case it's mostly directed at people who've implemented, and ideally deployed, the specification. The Council then votes to move it to Final.

-   No Call for Experience this month.

## Help us to build the newsletter

We started drafting in this [simple pad](https://yopad.eu/p/xmpp-newsletter-365days) in parallel to our efforts in the [XSF Github repository](https://github.com/xsf/xmpp.org/milestone/3). We are always happy to welcome contributors. Do not hesitate to join the discussion in our [Comm-Team group chat (MUC)](xmpp:commteam@muc.xmpp.org?join) and thereby help us sustain this as a community effort. 

You have a project and write about it? Please consider sharing your news or events here, and promote it to a large audience! 
Even if you can only spend a few minutes, these would already be helpful!

Tasks which need to be done on a regular basis are for example:

- Aggregation of news in the XMPP universe
- Short formulation of news and events
- Summary of the monthly communication on extensions (XEP)
- Review of the newsletter draft
- Preparation for media images
- Translations: especially German and Spanish
